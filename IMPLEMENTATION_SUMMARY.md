# Coupon System Implementation - Summary

## ✅ Completed Changes

### 1. Database Schema Updates
✅ **Coupons Table** - Added new fields:
- `name` - Coupon name/description
- `coupon_for` - User type (employee/employer)
- `status` - Approval status (pending/approved/rejected)
- `created_by` - Admin who created (renamed from staff_id)
- `approved_by` - Super admin who approved
- `approved_at` - Approval timestamp

✅ **New Coupon Users Table** - Created pivot table:
- Links coupons to specific employees/employers
- Tracks who assigned the user
- Prevents duplicate assignments

### 2. Models Updated/Created

✅ **Coupon Model** (`app/Models/Coupon.php`)
- Added UUID support
- Updated fillable fields
- Added relationships: `creator()`, `approver()`, `employees()`, `employers()`, `assignedUsers()`
- Added helper methods: `isValid()`, `isAssignedToUser()`

✅ **CouponUser Model** (`app/Models/CouponUser.php`) - NEW
- Pivot table model
- Relationships to Coupon, Admin, Employee, Employer

✅ **Admin Model** (`app/Models/Admin.php`)
- Updated `coupons()` relationship to use `created_by`

### 3. Controllers

✅ **CouponController** (`app/Http/Controllers/Api/CouponController.php`) - NEW
- `createCoupon()` - Staff, Manager, Super Admin can create
- `getCoupons()` - Role-based filtering (staff: own, manager: own+staff, super_admin: all)
- `getCoupon()` - Get single coupon with assigned users
- `getPendingCoupons()` - Super Admin only
- `approveCoupon()` - Super Admin only
- `assignUsers()` - Assign employees/employers by email/phone
- `removeUser()` - Remove user from coupon
- `deleteCoupon()` - Super Admin only (if no users assigned)

✅ **AdminController** (`app/Http/Controllers/Api/AdminController.php`)
- Removed old `createCoupon()` and `getCoupons()` methods

✅ **PaymentController** (`app/Http/Controllers/Api/PaymentController.php`)
- Updated `validateCoupon()` to check:
  - Coupon is approved
  - User is assigned to coupon
  - Coupon type matches user type
  - Plan type matches coupon type

### 4. Routes Updated

✅ **Admin Routes** (`routes/api.php`)
```
POST   /api/v1/admin/coupons                                 - Create coupon
GET    /api/v1/admin/coupons                                 - List coupons
GET    /api/v1/admin/coupons/pending                         - Pending coupons (Super Admin)
GET    /api/v1/admin/coupons/{id}                            - Get coupon details
PUT    /api/v1/admin/coupons/{id}/approve                    - Approve/reject (Super Admin)
POST   /api/v1/admin/coupons/{id}/assign-users               - Assign users
DELETE /api/v1/admin/coupons/{couponId}/users/{assignmentId} - Remove user
DELETE /api/v1/admin/coupons/{id}                            - Delete coupon (Super Admin)
```

✅ **Public Routes** (existing route updated)
```
POST /api/v1/coupons/validate - Validate coupon for redemption
```

### 5. Migrations Run Successfully

✅ Migration 1: `2025_10_22_105230_update_coupons_table_add_new_fields.php`
✅ Migration 2: `2025_10_22_105237_create_coupon_users_table.php`

Both migrations executed successfully with doctrine/dbal installed.

## 📋 Workflow

1. **Create Coupon** (Staff/Manager/Super Admin)
   - Coupon created with status: `pending`

2. **Approve Coupon** (Super Admin only)
   - Super Admin reviews and approves/rejects
   - Status changes to `approved` or `rejected`

3. **Assign Users** (Staff/Manager/Super Admin)
   - Only approved coupons can have users assigned
   - Users added by email or phone number
   - Staff can only assign to their own coupons
   - Manager can assign to their own + staff's coupons
   - Super Admin can assign to any coupon

4. **Redeem Coupon** (Employee/Employer)
   - User must be assigned to the coupon
   - Coupon must be approved and not expired
   - Coupon type must match user type
   - Used during plan upgrade

## 🔐 Role-Based Access Control

```

Output shows 9 routes properly registered with correct middleware.

## 📦 Dependencies

Added `doctrine/dbal` package (v3.10.3) for database schema modifications.

## 🧪 Ready for Testing

The system is now ready for:
1. Manual testing via Postman/Thunder Client
2. Frontend integration
3. End-to-end testing of the complete workflow

## 📖 Documentation

Three comprehensive documentation files created:
1. **COUPON_API_DOCUMENTATION.md** - Complete API documentation with examples
